## Overview
A **Weather Classification System** that predicts whether it will RAIN OR NOT based on weather features.  
Built with a pipeline combining **Column Transformer** and **Random Forest Classifier** to effectively handle both categorical and numerical features and deployed as a **REST API** using **Flask**, with a simple **HTML/CSS front-end** for user interaction.

## Features
- Predicts **Rain / No Rain** based on user input  
- Shows **probability of rain** and **probability of no rain**  
- Fully deployable locally via Flask API  
- Interactive **front-end** built with HTML/CSS  

## Model
- **Random Forest Classifier** wrapped inside a **Pipeline** with a **Column Transformer**.  
- Handles both **categorical** (e.g., Summary) and **numerical** features (e.g., Temperature, Humidity).  
- Achieved **high accuracy** on this dataset.  
- Because of this strong baseline performance, **no hyperparameter tuning** (Grid Search, Cross-Validation, or methods like Elbow plot, roc curve) was performed.
